# **GovDocs Simplifier**  
**Team Name:** TechOrbit

## **About The Project**
**GovDocs Simplifier** is a user-friendly web platform designed to help citizens easily understand complex government documents like policies, legal notices, schemes, and circulars. Through AI-powered text simplification, it converts legal and bureaucratic language into everyday language. This tool aims to bridge the gap between government communications and the public, ensuring that everyone, regardless of their education level, can access and benefit from government schemes and policies.

### **Problem Statement**
Government documents are often filled with complex jargon and technical terms that make them difficult to understand for the general public. This results in a lack of awareness about available schemes and rights, creating a significant information gap. Our goal is to break this barrier by simplifying these documents, making them accessible to everyone.

### **Our Solution**
GovDocs Simplifier provides a simple, effective solution to this problem by:
- Allowing users to upload PDF government documents.
- Using AI and NLP models like OpenAI and HuggingFace to extract, process, and simplify the content.
- Displaying the original and simplified versions side-by-side for easy comparison.
- Offering a history of previously uploaded documents for reference.
- Future updates will include multi-language support (Hindi, regional languages) and an interactive Q&A chatbot.

## **Key Features**
- **AI-Powered Text Simplification:** Converts complex government text into plain language.
- **Side-by-Side Comparison:** View the original document and simplified version together.
- **Document History:** Keep track of all uploaded documents in your dashboard.
- **Future Language Support:** Multi-language support, including Hindi, for wider accessibility.
- **Interactive Chatbot (Planned):** A chatbot for answering questions about documents.

## **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **AI/NLP:** OpenAI GPT-4, HuggingFace Transformers
- **PDF Handling:** pdf-parse (or similar)
- **Hosting/Deployment:** Vercel (Frontend), Render/Railway (Backend)

## **Team Members**

### **Ritesh Ray** - Backend Developer & Integration  + Deployment (Team Leader)
Ritesh was in charge of the backend development and system integration. Using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, he built the server-side logic to handle document uploads, simplify the text, and serve it back to the frontend. He also integrated the AI models from **OpenAI GPT-4**  to process the documents efficiently. Ritesh worked with Raeen to ensure smooth integration between the frontend and backend.

### **Raeen Fatima** - Frontend Developer & UI/UX Design (Member)
Raeen worked on the entire frontend development, ensuring that the platform’s user interface is intuitive and accessible. She used **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS** to create a responsive and user-friendly design. Raeen was also involved in integrating AI models into the frontend to ensure a smooth user experience when viewing simplified documents.

### **Adelli Chandana** - Research & Presentation  (Member)
 She focused on selecting the best models for document simplification and fine-tuning them for legal and bureaucratic language. Adelli was also responsible for preparing the project presentation, ensuring clear communication of the project’s impact, technical details, and future potential.

## **Project Roadmap**
- **Multi-Language Support:** We plan to add support for Hindi and regional languages.
- **Mobile Version:** A mobile-friendly design will be developed to ensure wider access.
- **Interactive Chatbot:** A chatbot will be added for users to directly ask questions related to documents.
